    <h4> Dear Participant </h4>
<h4> Hello! </h4>
<p> Thanks for participating in our study. </p>

<p> You are going to play an online game with another human co-player for a social
 decision-making task. It should take approximately <b> 60 minutes </b>  to complete the study.
You are eligible to take part in this study if you are between <b> 18 and 45 years old  </b> and speak  <b> English </b>  fluently.
 </p>

<p>Please only use a <b> laptop </b>  to participate in this study.
    We will only record your choices and reaction times in the game.
    To protect your privacy, we will create a unique alphanumeric string that identifies your data set.
    During data collection this string will be linked to some
    personal information (like your Prolific ID and some demographic information).
    Once data collection has ended, the key that links the alphanumeric string with <b> the Prolific ID will
    be destroyed and the data will be completely anonymized.</b>
    Before this you can request that your data will be deleted for whatever reason,
    but <b> after anonymization we cannot identify your data set any longer and therefore cannot delete it anymore. </b>
    Only anonymized data will be analyzed.
    During this period only the principal investigator and the research
    team (see below) will have access to your data for research purposes only.
    <b> Upon publication of the results the data will stored in an open access repository
    without any identifying information end for research purposes only. </b>  </p>

<p> Eligible participants will be compensated at <b> 10 pounds  </b>
    per hour for completing the game through the online survey software Prolific Academic.
    <b> A performance-based bonus will be added based on your final total score.</b>   </p>

<p> If you have any questions about the study,
    you can contact the Principal Investigator,
    <b> Jan Gläscher: glaescher@uke.de </b>  or Lead Research Scientist <b> Sepideh Khoneiveh: s.khoneiveh@uke.de. </b>  </p>

<p> Participation in this research study is your choice.
    <b> You may withdraw your participation at any time </b> , even after completing this form,
    with no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. However,
    <b> only if you complete the entire study, we will be able to pay you for your participation.</b>
    If you leave the study, the information you provided will be deleted.  </p>

<p> Before starting the main study,
    we are going to show you a few <b> instructional videos that explain the game.</b>
    After that we will <b>  ask you some questions about the instructions </b> to make sure that
    you have understood the study completely. So please go to a quiet place and be attentive to the game. .</p>
